# Summary

This was my second project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree program. We were provided with a design mockup (screenshot) of a developer portfolio webpage, and had to replicate the design with HTML and CSS. 

<img src="docs/img/design-mockup-portfolio-thumbnail-square.png" alt="Portfolio website mockup">

I based the webpage on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) v4.0.0-beta. In the main webpage *index.html*, I linked to the Bootstrap core CSS through their Content Delivery Network (CDN), and created *portfolio.css* for additional custom styling. 

I provided a toggle button in the footer that uses jQuery JavaScript to change the page color scheme.

The repository for this project is available at https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd01-p02-portfolio. 

I used the webpage design to create a full website with Jekyll, and hosted the site with GitHub Pages at https://br3ndonland.github.io/udacity-fsnd01-p02-portfolio. The website has three pages: "Home," an "About" page detailing how I built the site, and a "Rubric" page providing the Udacity documentation for the project and a comparison with the Udacity project rubric.
