## Code style

### Python <!-- omit in toc -->

- Python code chunks are formatted for Python 3 and [PEP 8](http://pep8.org/).
- When permitted, I amend PEP 8 to permit a line length of 100 characters.

### HTML and CSS <!-- omit in toc -->

- Two space indentations.
- Standard [HTML nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).
- [Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/) and classes

### Markdown <!-- omit in toc -->

- Standardized Markdown formatting as described by [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) and [Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).
- Two space indentations.
- Dashes for unordered lists.
